	A: To work on the same code as your group, make sure you have included and selected a "shared" "Group X" study when creating your workspace. Inside the workspace's jupyter notebook, you should see a folder labeled "shared" under the studies tab. All files and code included in this folder will be shared with your group. When saving code and temporary data, we recommend saving code in outside of the studies folder, and only moce them to the shared folder onc you'de like to share amongst your peers.
