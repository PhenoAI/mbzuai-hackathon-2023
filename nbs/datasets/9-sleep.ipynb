    "\n",
    "Sleep monitoring includes sleep staging, body positioning, respiratory events, heart rate, oxygen saturation and snoring, measured concurrently over three nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder in which a personâ€™s breathing is interrupted during sleep due to obstruction of the upper airway as a result of relaxation of the throat muscles. This obstruction can lead to pauses in breathing for short periods of time, which can cause loud snoring, reduction in the  blood oxygen levels, stress response, awakening and fragmented sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "A home sleep apnea test (HSAT) is a non-invasive test used to diagnose sleep apnea. During an HSAT, a patient wears a portable device overnight to monitor their breathing, heart rate, oxygen levels, snoring, and other sleep patterns. The device records this data and it is then analyzed by clinically-validated algorithms that compute apnea-related indices. The data can also be used to study sleep architecture and other aspects of sleep, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and arrhythmia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The device used for sleep monitoring in the Human Phenotype Project is the FDA-approved WatchPAT-300 by Itamar Medical. This device contains 5 sensors: An actigraph worn on the wrist; A pulse oximeter and a Peripheral Arterial Tone (PAT) probe worn on the finger; and a microphone and accelerometer worn on the chest for respiratory effort, snoring and body position measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The device's algorithms provide 3 main indices for diagnosis of OSA: Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI), Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI), Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI). The device's algoithms also provide indices for diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation (not FDA-approved yet): Premature beats per minute, Atrial fibrillation longest event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WatchPAT device is given to participants during the visit to the clinical testing center who then record 3 nights of sleep at home during the following two weeks (Figure 4). The recorded tested nights should reflect the usual sleeping regimen / typical bedtime (for example, not after exceeding alcohol consumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "The information is stored in 2 main statistics parquet files: `main.parquet`, `hrv.parquet`; In a sleep events file `events.parquet` and in multiple time series parquets / EDF files containing sensor channels for each night of logging."
